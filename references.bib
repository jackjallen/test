abstract = {Flow cytometry is often used to characterize the malignant cells in leukemia and lymphoma patients, traced to the level of the individual cell. Typically, flow-cytometric data analysis is performed through a series of 2-D projections onto the axes of the data set. Through the years, clinicians have determined combinations of different fluorescent markers which generate relatively known expression patterns for specific subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma - cancers of the hematopoietic system. By only viewing a series of 2-D projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e., information distance) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just two at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow-cytometric research. We refer to our method as information preserving component analysis (IPCA).},

abstract = {The utility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as a diagnostic technique is well established. CMR enables tissue characterization, distinction between myocardial scar tissue and viable tissue, and evaluation of myocardial perfusion and contractile function. To date, CMR has been mostly applied in the assessment of stable disease; however, a role for CMR in the acute setting is also emerging. An accurate appraisal of the myocardium with CMR in the first hours after the onset of chest pain could provide supporting information to standard diagnostic tools, such as electrocardiography and measurement of blood biomarkers, which could help guide the selection of appropriate treatment. The aims of this integrated approach include positive identification of an ischemic syndrome, estimation of downstream areas at risk of damage, evaluation of epicardial artery patency and small vessel integrity, quantification of infarct size, and determination of myocardial function. This Review critically evaluates both established and emerging CMR techniques, and relates the imaging findings to the underlying pathophysiological processes in acute coronary syndromes. A more thorough understanding of CMR techniques will clarify their potential clinical applications and limitations, and assess the practicality of CMR in the setting of acute coronary syndromes, where early intervention is crucial to save myocardium at risk of irreversible injury.},

abstract = {Motivation: Integrative mathematical and statistical models of cardiac anatomy and physiology can play a vital role in understanding cardiac disease phenotype and planning therapeutic strategies. However, the accuracy and predictive power of such models is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive imaging datasets. The Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) has established a large-scale database of cardiac imaging examinations and associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable, web-accessible, structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes. A goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups.Results: Three main open-source software components were developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client for 3D + time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations. The database was implemented using a three-tier architecture utilizing MySQL, JBoss and Dcm4chee, in compliance with the DICOM standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices. Parts of Dcm4chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters. To date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac imaging examinations are available in the database. All software components developed by the CAP are open source and are freely available under the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.txt).Availability: http://www.cardiacatlas.orgContact: a.young@auckland.ac.nzSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of the heart is a rapidly developing area of research in medical imaging. Advances in hardware and methods for fast spatio-temporal cardiac imaging are extending the frontiers of clinical diagnosis and research on cardiovascular diseases. In the last few years, many approaches have been proposed to analyze images and extract parameters of cardiac shape and function from a variety of cardiac imaging modalities. In particular, techniques based on spatio-temporal geometric models have received considerable attention. This paper surveys the literature of two decades of research on cardiac modeling. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) to serve as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, (2) to provide an extensive account of modeling techniques in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and (3) to critically review these approaches in terms of their performance and degree of clinical evaluation with respect to the final goal of cardiac functional analysis. From this review it is concluded that whereas 3-D model-based approaches have the capability to improve the diagnostic value of cardiac images, issues as robustness, 3-D interaction, computational complexity and clinical validation still require significant attention.},

abstract = {A novel method is introduced for the generation of landmarks for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes and the construction of the corresponding 3-D statistical shape models. Automatic landmarking of a set of manual segmentations from a class of shapes is achieved by 1) construction of an atlas of the class, 2) automatic extraction of the landmarks from the atlas, and 3) subsequent propagation of these landmarks to each example shape via a volumetric nonrigid registration technique using multiresolution B-spline deformations. This approach presents some advantages over previously published methods: it can treat multiple-part structures and requires less restrictive assumptions on the structure's topology. In this paper, we address the problem of building a 3-D statistical shape model of the left and right ventricle of the heart from 3-D magnetic resonance images. The average accuracy in landmark propagation is shown to be below 2.2 mm. This application demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of the method in the presence of large shape variability and multiple objects.},

abstract = {Segmenting the right ventricle (RV) in magnetic resonance (MR) images is required for cardiac function assessment. The segmentation of the RV is a difficult task due to low contrast with surrounding tissues and high shape variability. To overcome these problems, we introduce a segmentation method based on a statistical shape model obtained with a principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of representative shapes of the RV. Shapes are not represented by a set of points, but by distance maps to their contour, relaxing the need for a costly landmark detection and matching process. A shape model is thus obtained by computing a PCA on the shape variations. This prior is registered onto the image via a very simple user interaction and then incorporated into the well-known graph cut framework in order to guide the segmentation. Our semi-automatic segmentation method has been applied on 248 MR images of a publicly available dataset (from MICCAI’12 Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge). We show that encouraging results can be obtained for this challenging application.},

Methods We performed cardiac MRI in 72 patients (male 87\%, age 60 years) before and 6 months after successful PCI (43/72) or unsuccessful PCI (29/72) of a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO). Before PCI, 5 viability parameters were evaluated: transmural extent of infarction (TEI), contractile reserve during dobutamine, end diastolic wall thickness, unenhanced rim thickness and segmental wall thickening of the unenhanced rim (SWTur). Multivariate analysis was performed and based on the regression coefficient (RC) a predictive score was constructed. Diagnostic performance to predict improvement in myocardial function for each parameter and for the viability score was determined. Results The predictive value of a combination of contractile reserve, SWTur and TEI was incremental to TEI alone (AUROC 0.91 vs. 0.77; p \&lt; 0.001). A viability score of ≥ 5 based on contractile reserve (RC = 4), SWTur (RC = 1) and TEI (RC = 2) was 91\% sensitive and 84\% specific in predicting improvement of myocardial function. Conclusion Combining viability parameters results in a better prediction of improvement of dysfunctional myocardial segments after a successful PCI.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical follow-up studies comparing left ventricular (LV) function and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by high-field 3T cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are of general interest due to the increased use of 3T scanners. In this study, the occurrence of LGE and LV regional wall remodeling (RWR) was assessed by 3T CMR in patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods: Analysis of myocardial viability by LGE was performed at the segmental level. LVRWR was identified by a significant reduction (≥50\%) of the wall thickness. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were registered during a median follow-up time of 58 (45–62) months. Results: Of the 87 patients (59 ± 9 years; 13 women) enrolled, nonviable myocardium was detected in 35 (40\%) and significant CAD in 69 (79\%). Nonviable myocardium was correlated to angiographic significant stenosis or occlusion. LVRWR was significantly related to a higher number of nonviable segments compared to those without LVRWR: ie, 6.0 ± 3.2 segments versus 2.6 ± 1.3; P < 0.001. In the nonviable group, LVEF was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) compared to the viable group: ie, 50 ± 16\% versus 61 ± 8\%, and LVEF was significantly correlated to the number of nonviable segments (r = –0.66, P < 0.001). The number of nonviable segments by LGE was significantly associated with MACE by an odds ratio of 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.05–1.49; P = 0.013). Conclusion: The presence of nonviable myocardium as detected by LGE at 3T CMR is associated with angiographically significant CAD, and is associated with the development of LVRWR and reduced LVEF. Assessing the extent of nonviable myocardium by both LGE and LVRWR at the segmental level may therefore contribute to individualized risk stratification and treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Background—Preterm birth leads to an early switch from fetal to postnatal circulation before completion of left ventricular in utero development. In animal studies this results in an adversely remodeled left ventricle. We determined whether preterm birth is associated with a distinct left ventricular structure and function in humans. Methods and Results—234 individuals aged 20-39 years underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance. 102 had been followed prospectively since preterm birth (gestational age = 30.3±2.5weeks and birthweight = 1.3±0.3kilograms) and 132 were born at term to uncomplicated pregnancies. Longitudinal and short-axis cine images were used to quantify: left ventricular mass, three-dimensional geometric variation by creation of a unique computational cardiac atlas, and myocardial function. We then determined whether perinatal factors modify these left ventricular parameters. Individuals born preterm had increased left ventricular mass (66.5±10.9 vs 55.4±11.4g/m2, P<0.001) with greater prematurity associated with greater mass (r=-0.22, P=0.03). Preterm-born individuals had short left ventricles with small internal diameters and a displaced apex. Ejection fraction was preserved (P>0.99) but both longitudinal systolic (peak strain, strain rate and velocity, P<0.001) and diastolic (peak strain rate and velocity, P<0.001) function, as well as rotational (apical and basal peak systolic rotation rate, P=0.05 and P=0.006, and net twist angle, P=0.02) movement, were significantly reduced. A diagnosis of preeclampsia during the pregnancy was associated with further reductions in longitudinal peak systolic strain in the offspring (P=0.02, n=29). Conclusions—Individuals born preterm have increased left ventricular mass in adult life. Furthermore, they exhibit a unique three-dimensional left ventricular geometry as well as significant reductions in systolic and diastolic functional parameters.

abstract = {Importance Regional left ventricular (LV) wall thinning is believed to represent chronic transmural myocardial infarction and scar tissue. However, recent case reports using delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging raise the possibility that thinning may occur with little or no scarring.Objective To evaluate patients with regional myocardial wall thinning and to determine scar burden and potential for functional improvement.Design, Setting, and Patients Investigator-initiated, prospective, 3-center study conducted from August 2000 through January 2008 in 3 parts to determine (1) in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing CMR viability assessment, the prevalence of regional wall thinning (end-diastolic wall thickness ≤5.5 mm), (2) in patients with thinning, the presence and extent of scar burden, and (3) in patients with thinning undergoing coronary revascularization, any changes in myocardial morphology and contractility.Main Outcomes and Measures Scar burden in thinned regions assessed using delayed-enhancement CMR and changes in myocardial morphology and function assessed using cine-CMR after revascularization.Results Of 1055 consecutive patients with CAD screened, 201 (19\% [95\% CI, 17\% to 21\%]) had regional wall thinning. Wall thinning spanned a mean of 34\% (95\% CI, 32\% to 37\% [SD, 15\%]) of LV surface area. Within these regions, the extent of scarring was 72\% (95\% CI, 69\% to 76\% [SD, 25\%]); however, 18\% (95\% CI, 13\% to 24\%) of thinned regions had limited scar burden (≤50\% of total extent). Among patients with thinning undergoing revascularization and follow-up cine-CMR (n = 42), scar extent within the thinned region was inversely related to regional (r = −0.72, P \&lt; .001) and global (r = −0.53, P \&lt; .001) contractile improvement. End-diastolic wall thickness in thinned regions with limited scar burden increased from 4.4 mm (95\% CI, 4.1 to 4.7) to 7.5 mm (95\% CI, 6.9 to 8.1) after revascularization (P \&lt; .001), resulting in resolution of wall thinning. On multivariable analysis, scar extent had the strongest association with contractile improvement (slope coefficient, −0.03 [95\% CI, −0.04 to −0.02]; P \&lt; .001) and reversal of thinning (slope coefficient, −0.05 [95\% CI, −0.06 to −0.04]; P \&lt; .001).Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with CAD referred for CMR and found to have regional wall thinning, limited scar burden was present in 18\% and was associated with improved contractility and resolution of wall thinning after revascularization. These findings, which are not consistent with common assumptions, warrant further investigation.},

@article{Styner2003,
abstract = {Knowledge about the biological variability of anatomical objects is essential for statistical shape analysis and discrimination between healthy and pathological structures. This paper describes a novel approach that incorporates the variability of an object population into the generation of a characteristic 3D shape model. The proposed shape representation is a coarse-scale sampled medial description derived from a fine-scale spherical harmonics (SPHARM) boundary description. This medial description is composed of a net of medial samples (m-rep) with fixed graph properties. The medial model is computed automatically from a predefined shape space using pruned 3D Voronoi skeletons. A new method determines the stable medial branching topology from the shape space. An intrinsic coordinate system and an implicit correspondence between shapes is defined on the medial manifold. Several studies of biological structures clearly demonstrate that the novel representation has the promise to describe shape changes in a natural and intuitive way. A new medial shape similarity study of group differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in lateral ventricle shape demonstrates the meaningful and powerful representation of local and global form.},

@article{Tsai2013,
abstract = {The statistical shape model (SSM) method that uses 2D images of the knee joint to predict the three-dimensional (3D) joint surface model has been reported in the literature. In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30 ± 0.81 mm, 0.34 ± 0.79 mm and 0.36 ± 0.59 mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average ± standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30 s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time. Thus, it may have a broad application in computer-assisted knee surgeries that require 3D surface models of the knee.},

@article{VanAssen2006,
abstract = {A new technique (SPASM) based on a 3D-ASM is presented for automatic segmentation of cardiac MRI image data sets consisting of multiple planes with arbitrary orientations, and with large undersampled regions. Model landmark positions are updated in a two-stage iterative process. First, landmark positions close to intersections with images are updated. Second, the update information is propagated to the regions without image information, such that new locations for the whole set of the model landmarks are obtained. Feature point detection is performed by a fuzzy inference system, based on fuzzy C-means clustering. Model parameters were optimized on a computer cluster and the computational load distributed by grid computing. SPASM was applied to image data sets with an increasing sparsity (from 2 to 11 slices) comprising images with different orientations and stemming from different MRI acquisition protocols. Segmentation outcomes and calculated volumes were compared to manual segmentation on a dense short-axis data configuration in a 3D manner. For all data configurations, (sub-)pixel accuracy was achieved. Performance differences between data configurations were significantly different (p<0.05) for SA data sets with less than 6 slices, but not clinically relevant (volume differences<4 ml). Comparison to results from other 3D model-based methods showed that SPASM performs comparable to or better than these other methods, but SPASM uses considerably less image data. Sensitivity to initial model placement proved to be limited within a range of position perturbations of approximately 20 mm in all directions.},

@article{Young2009,
abstract = {Integrative models of cardiac physiology are important for understanding disease and planning intervention. Multimodal cardiovascular imaging plays an important role in defining the computational domain, the boundary/initial conditions, and tissue function and properties. Computational models can then be personalized through information derived from in vivo and, when possible, non-invasive images. Efforts are now established to provide Web-accessible structural and functional atlases of the normal and pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes. Efficient and robust statistical representations of cardiac morphology and morphodynamics can thereby be obtained, enabling quantitative analysis of images based on such representations. Statistical models of shape and appearance can be built automatically from large populations of image datasets by minimizing manual intervention and data collection. These methods facilitate statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion characteristics across population groups, via the application of parametric mathematical modelling tools. These parametric modelling tools and associated ontological schema also facilitate data fusion between different imaging protocols and modalities as well as other data sources. Statistical priors can also be used to support cardiac image analysis with applications to advanced quantification and subject-specific simulations of computational physiology.},

Errors between model and manual contours were small (LV mass, 1.8 g ± 4.9 [mean ± SD]; end-diastolic volume, 2.2 mL ± 4.6; end-systolic volume, 2.3 mL ± 3.8). Estimates of global function could be obtained in 6 minutes, a time saving of 5–10 times over estimates with manual contouring.},
